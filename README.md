# Malicious-Things-Detection-Using-Ai

In the enhanced version of the script, there are two main types of AI-related features used:
This documentation provides detailed information about a Python-based tool designed for detecting
potentially malicious URLs using a combination of machine learning and AI features. The tool
incorporates TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BERT (Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings to analyze URL structures and content.
## Features
### 1. TF-IDF Features
- *URL Path:* Extracts information from the path component of the URL, considering the
hierarchical structure.
- *URL Query:* Extracts information from the query parameters of the URL, identifying keyvalue pairs.
- *URL Fragment:* Extracts information from the fragment component of the URL, capturing
additional context.
- *Script Content:* Extracts information from script tags in the HTML content of the webpage,
focusing on potential JavaScript-based threats.
### 2. BERT Embeddings Feature :
- *BERT Embeddings:* Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) to convert
URL features into dense vector representations. BERT embeddings capture contextual
information about the language used in the URL.
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries:
- requests: For fetching HTML content from URLs.
- scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization and machine learning model training.
- transformers: For BERT embeddings using pre-trained models.
## Installation
- Clone or download the script file (malicious_url_detector.py).
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
- Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
bash
pip install requests scikit-learn transformers
## Usage
- 1. Ensure that the Python environment has the necessary dependencies installed.
- 2. Run the script using the following command:
bash
python malicious_url_detector.py
- 3. The tool will prompt you to enter a URL for analysis.
- 4. The output will indicate whether the URL is classified as malicious or not, along with
detailed features extracted.
## Example Output
The tool provides a detailed output including TF-IDF features, script content, and BERT embeddingâ€™s
when classifying a URL:
Plaintext :
The URL http://example.com is malicious.
Features:
- URL Path: /path/to/malicious
- URL Query: ?malicious_param=1
- URL Fragment: #malicious_fragment
- Script Content: <script>malicious_script_code()</script>
- BERT Embeddings: [0.123, 0.456, ..., 0.789]
## Important Notes
- *Educational Purpose:* This tool is developed for educational purposes and is not intended for
production use without further enhancements.
- *Dataset and Model Considerations:* The tool's effectiveness depends on the quality and diversity
of the dataset used for training and the sophistication of the models employed.
- *Security Considerations:* Ensure proper permissions and ethical use when analyzing URLs. Do not
use this tool for any malicious purposes.
